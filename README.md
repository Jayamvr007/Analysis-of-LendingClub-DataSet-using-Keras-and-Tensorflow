# Analysis-of-LendingClub-DataSet-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow
Historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we build a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? We use tensorflow and keras for analysis and prediction.
